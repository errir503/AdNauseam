      Argumentum ad nauseam is a latin phrase used in the situation where you have heard an argument so often that it almost makes you nausious to hear it again-- to the point of nausea. It is interesting that this phrase begins with 'ad'.

      The discussion centering on the pervasiveness of advertising, privacy, ad-blockers and so on is all consuming. How much data do the advertisers really have on us? Are they using the data they have on us for evil purposes? Why am I not getting a cut of the check going to Amazon and Facebook when they make money selling my data?

      Truth is is that the digital advertising word is very complex, there are ad networks, demand side buyers, supply side buyers, content publishers, advertisers. There is a lot of money to be made, and everyone is trying to make it. And the industry evolves so quickly that no one person knows exactly whats happening.
