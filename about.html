      Argumentum ad nauseam is a latin phrase used to describe the situation where you've heard an argument so often that it makes you sick to hear it again-- to the point of nausea. It is interesting that this phrase begins with 'ad'. The discussion centering on the pervasiveness of advertising, privacy, ad-blockers and so on is all consuming. How much data do the advertisers really have on us? Are they using the data they have on us for evil purposes? Why am I not getting a cut of the check going to Amazon and Facebook when they make money selling my data? Truth is, the digital advertising world is very complex: there are ad networks, demand side buyers, content publishers, advertisers and everyone is trying to keep pace with technology and the rapidly diminishing consumer attention span. There is a lot of money to be made and everyone is trying to make it, inventing new ways to get you to click on things. The industry is evolving so quickly that no one person knows exactly how the ecosystem as a whole works. This is especially true for the aaverage user of the internet. You have no idea what is going on around you and how everything functions.
